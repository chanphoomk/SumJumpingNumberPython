# Programming question: Jumpy numbers

A jumpy number is a positive integer whose digits neither increase nor decrease.

For example, 1259, 477, 269 are increasing numbers, and 872, 520, 9661 are decreasing. These are NOT jumpy numbers.

Examples of jumpy numbers are 101, 103, 194, 4831, 548, 9935. Note that 111, 4444 are not jumpy numbers.

There cannot be any jumpy numbers below one-hundred.
